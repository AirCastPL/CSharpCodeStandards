2. Naming Conventions
=====================
Consistency is the key to maintainable code. This statement is most true for naming your projects, source files, and
identifiers including Fields, Variables, Properties, Methods, Parameters, Classes, Interfaces, and Namespaces.

2.1 General Guidelines
----------------------
1. Always use Camel Case or Pascal Case names.
2. Avoid ALL CAPS and all lowercase names. Single lowercase words or letters are acceptable.
3. Do not create declarations of the same type (namespace, class, method, property, field, or parameter) and access modifier (protected, public, private, internal) that vary only by capitalization.
4. Do not use names that begin with a numeric character.
5. Do add numeric suffixes to identifier names.
6. Always choose meaningful and specific names.
7. Always err on the side of verbosity not terseness.
8. Variables and Properties should describe an entity not the type or size.
9. Do not use Hungarian Notation!
    Example: strName or iCount

10. Avoid using abbreviations unless the full name is excessive.
11. Avoid abbreviations longer than 5 characters.
12. Any Abbreviations must be widely known and accepted.
13. Use uppercase for two-letter abbreviations, and Pascal Case for longer abbreviations.
14. Do not use C# reserved words as names.
15. Avoid naming conflicts with existing .NET Framework namespaces, or types.
16. Avoid adding redundant or meaningless prefixes and suffixes to identifiers
17. Do not include the parent class name within a property name.
Example: Customer.Name NOT Customer.CustomerName
18. Try to prefix Boolean variables and properties with ¡§Can¡¨, ¡§Is¡¨ or ¡§Has¡¨.
19. Append computational qualifiers to variable names like Average, Count, Sum, Min, and Max where appropriate.
20. When defining a root namespace, use a Product, Company, or Developer Name as the root.
